    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My best friend and I created this dish back when we were still at the university
        and we didn t have much money. Therefore, the ingredients are quite affordable
        and this without taking away any of the good flavours.
    </p>
    <p>
        As always, this dish is a little spicy but it also has a little sweet touch. 
        It is perfect to eat with a good beer and friends.
