# Odin-Recipes
This is my first project on web developpement. This webpage will be updated and improved as I learn more about html, css and javascript.

Step 1 (basic html):

I will make a page with different recipes and pictures to practice the basic skills that I learned on html. Which are:

- Creating a page
- Headings
- Using paragraph
- Using bold
- Using italic
- Adding links
- Making other pages
- Adding images

Step 2 (to be continued)
